# Getting Started With Clojure

## Why Clojure?
Clojure is a pragmatically functional language that emphasis programming by manipulating immutable data structures. Although it has a somewhat peculiar lisp syntax, Clojure programs are often elegantly small and simple. Clojure compiles either to Java bytecode to be run on the JVM or JavaScript that runs on the server or in browsers.
