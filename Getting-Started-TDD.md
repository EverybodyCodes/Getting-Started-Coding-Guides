# Getting Started With Unit Testing & Test-Driven Development

## Why Unit Testing & TDD?
Automated tests such as unit tests help coders to quickly run their functions & components through many, many different cases. As applications get larger and larger, this saves an exponential amount of time and helps give the engineer confidence that the code is ready to deploy.
